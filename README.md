# Heart Disease Detection Project

## Overview
A machine learning-powered web application designed to predict heart disease risk using patient medical data. The project employs logistic regression to analyze multiple health indicators and provide early risk assessment.

## Features
- Machine learning heart disease prediction model
- Web interface for user input
- Comprehensive health risk analysis
- User authentication system

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- HTML/CSS
- Logistic Regression algorithm

## Dataset
The project uses a comprehensive medical dataset containing 13 key health indicators:
- Age
- Gender
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Major Vessels Count
- Thalassemia Status

## Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Test Set Accuracy: Dynamically calculated during runtime
- Predicts heart disease likelihood with binary classification

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the prediction script:
   ```
   python Main.py
   ```

## Web Interface
- Login/Signup pages for user management
- Interactive form for entering medical parameters
- Real-time heart disease risk prediction
